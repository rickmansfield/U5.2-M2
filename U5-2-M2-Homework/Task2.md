# Unit 5.2 M2 Task 2

What are the primary weaknesses of a hash table?

1. They are not that flexible because you can only use integers as keys. 
2. If you have the key, you can quickly retrieve the value. However, if you have the value and need to get the keys, that is slow O(n) operation. 
3. In the worst case, all operations have an O(n) time complexity 
4. The keys are not stored in any order. 
5. None of the above. 

My answers were numbers 2 and 3.
